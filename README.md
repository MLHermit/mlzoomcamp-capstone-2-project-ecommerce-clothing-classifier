# mlzoomcamp-capstone-2-project-ecommerce-clothing-classifier

Automating garment classification is the aim of this repo, pytorch's CNN model was implemented for image classification to automatically categorize new clothing listings, making it easier for a person, customer to find what they're looking for. This will assist in inventory management by quickly sorting items. The primary objective is to develop a machine learning model capable of accurately categorizing images of clothing items into distinct garment types such as shirts, trousers, shoes, etc.
